Dynamical programming. Task Description
Consider an ant on grid of squares on point (0,0). The ant can move only right or upwards with 1 unit at a time (i.e. in the first step it can go to either (0,1) or (1,0)). We know, that there are obstacles in certain points which the ant cannot cross, these are at: (1,3), (3,3), (3,6), (4,3), (6,4), (6,6), (14,12). Select the TRUE statements from below.

There are 2 paths to (1,1)
There are 7 paths to (2,3)
There are 51 paths to (5,5)
There are 115 paths to (6,7)
There are 736 paths to (8,7)
There are 551 paths to (7,8)
There are 883023 paths to (13,12)
There are 37963602 paths to (15,16)
There are 592095012 paths to (17,18)
